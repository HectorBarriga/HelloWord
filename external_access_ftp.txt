Our server (atlas) accessible via  86.43.69.175 IP address (and port 15202 on putty) is only a 'connection point' to access our local network externally. 
All our documents are on internal server called tangier.
To simplify access to tangier folders (as well as access other nodes on tango local network) you need to setup a tunnel as following:

Add following settings in your putty session used for external access to tango server:

Category->Connection->SSH->Tunnels
There add new forwarded port :

source port : 5002
destination : tangier:80        http://localhost:5002/

Press add button.

Then save the session and login to tango.

This will set a tunnel to tangier's port 80. To access tangier that way you will need refer to localnet:5001 when login using SFTP client.

You can also set tunnels to any node/port in tango localnet by using technique above. 
For instance to access jira on tangier add following:

source port : 5080
desination : tangier:8080
then use http://localhost:5080 in your web browser to access jira remotely.
ip 86.43.69.175  15202

source port : 6060
desination : tangier:80
then use http://localhost:6060/reference/helpdesk/index.html in your web browser to access helpdesk remotely.

Note: you may also add following setting in C:/windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts file (or /etc/hosts on unix):
127.0.0.1       localhost tangier

this will allow use tangier name instead of localnet:port.




After you successfully login to tango you can use any sftp client program to access folders on remote computer. 
You can use winSCP program to do so. 

WinSCP sftp/ftp client might be downloaded there:

http://winscp.net/eng/download.php#download2

use 'Multilanguage installation package'

Install it on your computer. When start winSCP input host name tangier, port 22 if it is being in tango and 15303 for remote access, user name : username and password (hector and tango's password when being in tango and hector and personal passowrd when being remotely), press login.
On success you will be in your tangier's personal directory (/export/home/username). To see the documents go to /export directory (in Address field).
You can now download/upload files from/to tangier.




no, 22 is useful if you need direct ssh access to certain host in tango localnet
[17:01:55] T - Andrey Kolganov: the guide just point sample os tunnels
[17:02:10] Hector Barriga: oh ok, I underestand :x
[17:02:16] T - Andrey Kolganov: you can open many tunnels to different nodes and different ports
[17:02:38] Hector Barriga: yes it is true, thanks a millon Andrey
[17:03:27] T - Andrey Kolganov: for instance, you can add ssh tunnel to let say itangoA here like source port 5541 goes to itangoA:22
[17:04:02] T - Andrey Kolganov: then after you opened remote access you can open many ssh sessions to itangoA directly from you remote laptop
[17:05:20] T - Andrey Kolganov: source port may be any free local port number


source port : 5002
destination : tangier:80
HOST NAME: 86.43.69.175  PORT: 15202

source port : 5001
destination : atlas ssh on tangier tangier:22
HOST NAME: 86.43.69.175  PORT: 15202

source port : 5080
destination : atlas JIRA on tangier tangier:8080
