1)Copy and paste on desktop (it is just to make a backup and no touch the original key) the key that is used on winscp (it is on dell laptop C:\Documents and Settings\Hector\My Documents\TANGO\Utilities\Putty) for sftp.tangotelecom.com (see email Re: Remote access to Tango from Andrey Kolganov 25/01.2012). You must use the key that you use when connecting to sftp.telecom.com on winscp

2)Open puttygen (putty key generator).

3)Click on load

4)select the key that was saved on the desktop

5)On puttygen (putty key generator) select on the menu "conversiond" and "Export OpenSsH key" and save on the desktop as id_rsa. It saves it as id_rsa.ppk

6)Open winscp and select to open hector@atlas and transfer id_rsa. Get rid of the .ppk extencion and permitions to 600 and save it into the directory .ssh

7)once you are in /.ssh run the following comand :   sftp -o port=15303 hector@87.198.131.34 and use the same password you use when creating the key that is in C:\Documents and Settings\Hector\My Documents\TANGO\Utilities\Putty\)
