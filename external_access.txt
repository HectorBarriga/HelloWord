External access to tango server
---------------------------------------

Access to atlas is restricted.

Likewise, the telnet daemon is not allowed to run. The only mechanism to gain terminal access to atlas is via Secure Shell (ssh) or root login with a password from the system console. Only a few user accounts are allowed access, using SSH2 1024-bit public/private keys as described below.

To setup public/private keys using SSH, a recent version of PuTTY needs to be installed on Windows systems. Choose the Windows-style installer from:

http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html <<<<<<< OLD, might not be good

The 5 PUTTY binaries should be installed and it may be necessary to add the target directory to the PATH (click on My Computer/Properties/Advanced/Environment). 

puttygen is used to generate the keys; 
putty is used for gaining terminal access; 
psftp is an ssh ftp client.

Please refer to putty.hlp for more on setting up the public key SSH authentication (especially Chapter 8).

A synopsis of what needs to be done is as follows:

  1. Launch puttygen.exe

  2. In the Parameters section at the bottom of the window, select SSH2 RSA.

  3. In the Actions section (middle of window), click the Generate button.

  4. Shake your mouse pointer in the Key section until the key is generated.

  5. In the Key Comment field, type in a name for the key (e.g. “SSH2 key for atlas”).

  6. Enter and re-enter a passphrase (between 10 and 30 characters) –
     this passphrase is used to encrypt the file that will be used to
     store your SSH key on disk. You will be asked for this passphrase
     every time you need to use the key (e.g. to login).

  7. Click the “Save private key” button (Actions section) and choose
     an appropriate location and file name for the private key file.

  8. Select the content of the public key area in the Key section –
     this needs to be pasted into $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys2 on the
     target server (e.g. atlas).Note: do NOT save this to file : just copy
     content and paste it into email/editor and send to to administrator.

To use the key:

  1. Launch putty

  2. Create a Saved Session with a suitable name – the configuration
     items necessary are:

        1.Hostname or IP address of target server (86.43.69.175)

        2.Select the SSH protocol (use port number 15202)

        3.In the Connection category, enter your username ($HOME, normally your tangier's user name) in
           the “Auto-login username” field.

        4.In Connection ? SSH, select 2 as the preferred SSH protocol version.

        5.In Connection ? SSH ? Auth, click the browse button to  select the
          filename of the stored private key (item 7 in the previous list).

        6. Select the Session category again, enter a name for the session and
           click the saved button.

  3.Double-click on the saved session to launch an SSH2 encrypted
    session between your computer and the target server – you will be
    asked for the passphrase you entered in step 6 in the previous list.

To use the key with psftp, from a command prompt in Windows, enter        <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< DEPRICATED. Use WinSCP instead

   *    psftp <saved session name>

The <saved session name> is what was entered in step 2f above.
