Access to thor (tango internal sftp server)
-------------------------------------------

Access to thor is restricted. 

Likewise, the telnet daemon is not allowed to run. The only mechanism to gain terminal access to thor is via Secure FTP.
Only a few user accounts are allowed a remote/local access, using SSH2 1024-bit public/private keys (CO and some other authorised persons).

To use the key:

On unix :
save your private key as $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa
 
local access from tango localnet:
$sftp username@thor

remote access:
$sftp -oPort=15303 username@sftp.tangotelecom.com (you can also use sftp.tangotelecom.com instead of IP address)

On Windows :

  1. Launch win SCP

  2. Create a New session 
    input following items:

        1.Hostname or IP address of target server (87.198.131.34 or sftp.tangotelecom.com for remote access, thor for internal access)

        2.Select the SSH protocol (use port number 15303 for remote access, 22 for internal access)

        3.User name

        4.Select private key file

        5.Set protocol SFTP (default)

        6. Save the session with suiatable name (Save button)

  3.Double-click on the saved session to launch an SSH2 encrypted
    session between your computer and the target server. You will be
    asked for the passphrase.

On successful login you will login to /ftp/tango directory on the server. Normally all releases are kept in releases subdirectory. You also have access to your personal directory there : /home/username.
